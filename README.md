Xumina is a rapid application builder based on RILT (React, Inertia, Laravel, Tailwind). Build all kinds of app (admin panel, cms, blog, saas) in record time. With xumina not only you can build faster but it's also very beautiful, comes with lot's of theme and customization is very easy.

## Support development

I'd like to spend more time building the best app builder for RILT stack so sponsoring for the project will ensure I can spend as much time as possible and not take client projects. Reach me at searching.nehal@gmail.com
